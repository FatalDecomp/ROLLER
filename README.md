# ROLLER
![Roller logo](./images/whiplash.gif)

This project aims to implement all the functionality of the 1995 game Whiplash/Fatal Racing in a way that builds and runs on modern PCs. Where necessary, DOS-specific functions are substituted with SDL and Windows/Unix equivalents.

## TODO
* Integrate looped and pitched sounds (engine sounds) with SDL
* Integrate sound panning with SDL
* Integrate joystick support with SDL
* Find instrument/sample set for WildMidi that sounds closer to original hardware
* Bug: pits in devil's hairpin do not show doubled texture
* Bug: announcer can say multiple things at the same time
* Bug: clouds do not work
* Linux only: replay positioning is chunky
* Implement CD audio
* Implement modern networking

## About

Debug symbol dump generated with wdump, part of: https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2

Useful tool in generating nice asm output with symbols from wdump applied: https://github.com/fonic/wcdatool

Directions on how to use wcdatool and get remote debugging working with open watcom: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG9tEZOSrQg

Note: wdump symbol offsets do not account for DOS4GW.EXE. Load FATAL.EXE_split_dos4g_payload.exe (FATAL.EXE with DOS4GW.EXE split off, generated by wcdatool) into Ida/Ghidra to have matching symbol offsets.

Hashes of executables used for decomp:

FATAL.EXE
* `md5: 812EEE1404ECDFD87FF765281DF89720`
* `SHA256: 7789768C0A6CDC213EAF7B1AD8CC125531EB3FE7C213ECCAC6188E58F428687E`

FATAL.EXE_split_dos4g_payload.exe
* `md5: 05C2B0730641663133D76DD2CA552B4C`
* `SHA256: A4AD4131DBBFF9884DA4687D8B579B81117E6D23525950D942DF2DF585E2A11E`

## External Dependencies Used:
* SDL3.2.14: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL
* SDL_Image3.2.4: https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_image
* WildMIDI 0.4.6: https://github.com/Mindwerks/wildmidi

## Installation

Assets from a retail copy of the game are required to run. Drop the contents of the build directory (bin or zig-out) into the Whiplash/Fatal Racing install directory. ROLLER.exe should be in the same directory as WHIP.EXE/FATAL.EXE.

### ROLLER Installer

For easier installation and setup, see the [**ROLLER Installer**](installer/README.md) - a cross-platform installer that handles binary distribution, asset extraction, and configuration setup.

## Build MSVC
1. Clone repository
2. Open ROLLER.sln
3. Build project

## Build GCC
```bash
